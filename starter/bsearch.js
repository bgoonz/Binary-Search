  length is 0, this implementation passes in low and hi indices to determine
  what part of the original array is being searched.

  Base Case: 
  if low is equal to high and we haven't found targetNum, then return -1 to
  indicate that the value was not found
  
  Determine the slice point (the middle of lower and upper)

  If targetNum is less than nums[slicepoint], then

  'left' half of the array

  If targetNum is less than nums[slicepoint], then

  'right' half of the array

  If neither of those is true, return the slice point
